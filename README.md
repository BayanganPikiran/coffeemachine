The "coffee machine" performs three basic tasks: Turning off, reporting on available resources (water, milk, coffee, and money), and turning off.

In order to perform these tasks, we start with a dictionary containing the current available resources, as well resource
requirements for each of the available drinks.

With these given, the program performs five functions:

1) Prints available resources
2) Checks if available resources are sufficient for a given order
3) Processes coins for payment
4) Confirms whether the given coins are sufficient for the respective order, and either deposits the money and returns
    the change if coins are sufficient, or returns the coins if insufficient
5) Makes the coffee and deducts the resources used in doing so from the available resources
